### Part A: Calculate the average performance score for each employee


### Part B: Classify each employee based on the average performance score and print out the classification for each employee
## Let's make this a function so we can reuse it in Part D
def employee_classification (employees):
    ec_list = []
    for e in employees:
    
ec_list = employee_classification(employees)


### Part C. Find the employee with the highest salary in the "Engineering" department, and
highest_salary = 0
for e in employees:
    if e["department"]=="Engineering":


### Part D. Print a dictionary where the keys are the department names and the values are lists of employee names who belong to the "Excellent" category in each department.
excellent_emp = {}
ec_list = employee_classification(employees)

for e in ec_list:
