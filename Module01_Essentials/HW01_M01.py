##### Problem 1: Trim adapter reads and validate bases
## 1. Write a script that reads in adapter_reads.txt line by line and remove the first 14 base pair (characters) that are the adapters. 
## 2. Validate if the read is valid by ensuring that all the characters are in {A,T,C,G}. ie., Not another character eg N.
## 3. Write the valid trimmed reads to a new file, clean_reads.txt, and the invalid reads in another new file,  bad_reads.txt. 
## 4. Print as output, the number of valid and invalid reads. 


##### Problem 2: List comprehension statistic
## 1. Using the valid trimmed reads from problem 1, create a list comprehension command that returns the length of each valid read. 
## 2. Create a second list comprehension command that returns the GC% of each valid read (ie., GC.count/length). 
## 3. Print as output, the minimum length, max length, and average length of your valid trimmed reads. Additionally, print the average GC% rounded to 3 decimals.


##### Problem 3: Dictionary
## 1. Using the valid trimmed reads from problem 1, build a dictionary called 'base_counts' that has the total counts of A, T, C, G across all valid reads. 
## 2. Use a loop that iterates over the dictionary and compute and print the product of the four counts (A*C*T*G).


#### Problem 4: Function and asserts
## 1. Write a function that returns the percentage of any nt (A,T,C,G) in a sequence, rounded to 2 significant figure. 
## 2. Include 3 asserts to test your code including a known case (eg "AATT" with "A" returning 50.00) and a case with 0%.

## Use this sequence as your test sequence
sequence = TTATAAGCCGATTATAAGCCCGTAACCGGTTAG
